This is a great start. I'll share detailed feedback this weekend but overall the idea is awesome.

For now, there are a few things needed in the document. 
Need wireframes for the app in business plan. Draw it on a whiteboard and take picture, no fancy frames required at this point.
See offerup mobile app. That UI is close to this use case. Someone got a job, take a picture or describe and post, let someone pick up the job (Uber like model) and share an online quote to the customer via app. Customer approves -> appointment -> work done -> satisfaction score/reviews etc. 
 
Did you build the prototype already? Is it in progress? I'll fund you for the mobile/web prototype development with a cap if you need it.
I also shared with a few business folks and let you know their feedback.


Need more details on competition. What comes close to this and why that is not sufficient.

Write a Press Release - As if your product is ready and fully functional and you are launching it today. PR should communicate (some of this is already in business plan)
    Who is the customer
    What is the customer problem, why do they care, how is it better than what already exists
    What is the most important customer benefit
    How do you know what customer need or want
    What does customer experience look like

The format could be
    Heading - Short, compelling description -     One sentence summary - Eleator pitch
    First prara - Summary of what it is (Assume at 50% won't go beyond this. Get them excited)
    Second Para - Opportunity/ problem
    Third     - Approach/solutions
    Fourth - Fictitious quote from a customer - How it helped
    Fifth - Customer experience - Motivate the user to try this out
    closing para - Customer testimonial - make it up but realistic
    Call to action
    
Avoid Marketing buzzwords - HUGE, GREAT etc.  Keep it as simple as possible.
