Hi,

A few weeks ago, Google released Coral, a super fast, =E2=80=9Cno
internet required=E2=80=9D development board and USB accelerator that
enables deep learning practitioners to deploy their models =E2=80=9Con
the edge=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ccloser to the data=E2=80=9D (which is what w=
e'll be

Using Coral, deep learning developers are no longer required to
have an internet connection, meaning that the Coral TPU is fast
enough to perform inference directly on the device rather than
sending the image/frame to the cloud for inference and
prediction.

The Google Coral comes in two flavors:

* A single-board computer with an onboard Edge TPU. The dev board
can be thought of an =E2=80=9Cadvanced Raspberry Pi for AI=E2=80=9D or a
competitor to NVIDIA=E2=80=99s Jetson Nano.
* A USB accelerator that plugs into a device (such as a Raspberry
Pi). The USB stick includes an Edge TPU built into it. Think of
Google=E2=80=99s Coral USB Accelerator as a competitor to Intel=E2=80=99s
Movidius NCS.

Today we=E2=80=99ll be focusing on the Coral USB Accelerator as it=E2=80=99=
s
easier to get started with (and it fits nicely with our theme of
Raspberry Pi-related posts the past few weeks).

To learn how to configure the Google Coral USB accelerator, as
well as perform classification + object detection on the Coral,
you'll need to read the full tutorial here! ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/ey=

P.S. Google Coral, Movidius NCS, and NVIDIA Jetson Nano devices
are bringing computer vision and deep learning to resource
constrained systems such as embedded devices and the Raspberry
Pi.

In my opinion, embedded CV and DL is the next big wave in the AI
community. It=E2=80=99s so big that it may even be a tsunami =E2=80=94 will=
 you
be riding that wave?

I know I will be.

Will you join me?

To help you get your start in embedded Computer Vision and Deep
Learning, I have decided to write a brand new book =E2=80=94 Raspberry Pi
for Computer Vision. ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIjoiNDc2O=
DQyOSIsImRlbGl2ZXJ5X2lkIjoiNjI1NTYzMTQ1NyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtpY2tz=

wdXRlci12aXNpb24tZWJvb2s_X19zPXF1ZmNiaDEzZmNpNHJodjNxbW5jIn0 )

Inside this book you will learn how to:
* Build practical, real-world computer vision applications on the
Pi
* Create computer vision and Internet of Things (IoT) projects
and applications with the RPi
* Optimize your OpenCV code and algorithms on the resource
constrained Pi
* Perform Deep Learning on the Raspberry Pi (including utilizing
the Movidius NCS and OpenVINO toolkit)
* Configure your Google Coral, perform image classification and
object detection, and even train + deploy your own custom
models to the Coral Edge TPU!

* Utilize the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to run multiple deep neural
networks on a single board, including image classification,
object detection, segmentation, and more!

offering 25% OFF my existing books and courses if you pre-order a
copy of RPi for CV.

In fact, the Raspberry Pi for Computer Vision book is
practically free if you pre-order it with Deep Learning for
Computer Vision with Python or the PyImageSearch Gurus course.

The clock is ticking and these discounts won=E2=80=99t last =E2=80=94

Reserve your pre-order of RPi for CV now and while you're at it,
grab another course or book at a discounted rate. ( https://t.dripemail2.co=
