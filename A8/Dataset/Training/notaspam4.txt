Computer Society of India, Mumbai Chapter Presents Two days hands-on
workshop Machine Learning with Python *Date: 26-27 April 2019, 9:30 am
to 5:30 pm, Mumbai* 

 *Introduction* 

 In recent
times, there has been a sudden rise in demand of Machine Learning. The
prime reason behind this surge is the data driven and techno focused
approaches that majority of organizations have willingly embraced. The
Machine Learning Program is designed to impart an in-depth training in
the concepts and techniques of learning algorithms. The module is
designed to help participants learn machine learning techniques and
algorithms which can be applied using Python. The training program
will be entirely based on used cases which will give a hands-on
learning experiment.
