Good evening from Crete,

I mentioned in our #courses slack channel that we had one place left for tomorrow's Data Structures in Java Live Class.

That sold out pretty quickly.

However, one of the students requested to move to the next course. So we have one place left.

It is $149, plus VAT.

Please get it here: https://javaspecialists.teachable.com/p/data-structures-in-java-2019-03

It will be fun, whilst at the same time educational. Even if you know everything there is to about data structures, I bet you will learn at least one useful thing that will be worth your $149, and more importantly, your time.

We will spend a lot of time on the most useful data structures, but will also look at those you have maybe not used much, such as CopyOnWriteArrayList/Set and ConcurrentSkipListSet/Map.

See you tomorrow hopefully :-)

Kind regards

Heinz
