Hi there,

Today=E2=80=99s tutorial is inspired from PyImageSearch reader, Joao
Paulo Folador, a PhD student from Brazil.

Joao is interested in utilizing computer vision and machine
learning to automatically detect and predict Parkinson=E2=80=99s disease
based on geometric drawings ( https://t.dripemail2.com/c/eyJhY2NvdW50X2lkIj=

While I am familiar with Parkinson=E2=80=99s disease, I had not heard of
the geometric drawing test =E2=80=94 a bit of research led me to a 2017
paper, Distinguishing Different Stages of Parkinson=E2=80=99s Disease
Using Composite Index of Speed and Pen-Pressure of Sketching a
Spiral, by Zham et al.

The researchers found that the drawing speed was slower and the
pen pressure lower among Parkinson=E2=80=99s patients =E2=80=94 this
was especially pronounced for patients with a more acute/advanced
forms of the disease.

One of the symptoms of Parkinson=E2=80=99s is tremors and rigidity in the
muscles, making it harder to draw smooth spirals and waves.

Joao postulated that it might be possible to detect Parkinson=E2=80=99s
disease using the drawings alone rather than having to measure
the speed and pressure of the pen on paper.

Reducing the requirement of tracking pen speed and pressure:

* Eliminates the need for additional hardware when performing the
test.
* Makes it far easier to automatically detect Parkinson=E2=80=99s.

Graciously, Joao and his advisor allowed me access to the dataset
they collected of both spirals and waves drawn by (1) patients
with Parkinson=E2=80=99s, and (2) healthy participants.

I took a look at the dataset and considered our options.

Originally, Joao wanted to apply deep learning to the project,
but after consideration, I carefully explained that deep
learning, while powerful, isn=E2=80=99t always the right tool for the
job! You wouldn=E2=80=99t want to use a hammer to drive in a screw, for
instance.

Instead, you look at your toolbox, carefully consider your
options, and grab the right tool for the task at hand.

I explained this to Joao and then demonstrated how we can predict
Parkinson=E2=80=99s in images with 83.33% accuracy using standard
computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

To see which algorithms where used, and how to apply them to
Parkinson's detection, you'll need to read the full post here. ( https://t.=

P.S. Deep learning methods are all the rage right now, and yes,
they are super powerful, but deep learning doesn=E2=80=99t make other
computer vision techniques obsolete.

Instead, you need to bring the right tool to the job. You
wouldn=E2=80=99t try to bang in a screw with a hammer, you would instead
use a screwdriver. The same concept is true with computer vision
=E2=80=94 you bring the right tool to the job.

In order to help build your toolbox of computer vision algorithms
I have put together the PyImageSearch Gurus course. ( https://t.dripemail2.=

P19fcz1xdWZjYmgxM2ZjaTRyaHYzcW1uYyJ9 )

Inside the course you=E2=80=99ll learn:

* Machine learning and image classification
* Automatic License/Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)
* Face recognition
* How to train HOG + Linear SVM object detectors
* Content-based Image Retrieval (i.e., image search engines)
* Processing image datasets with Hadoop and MapReduce
* Hand gesture recognition
* Deep learning fundamentals
* =E2=80=A6and much more!

PyImageSearch Gurus is the most comprehensive computer vision
education online today, covering 13 modules broken out into 168
lessons, with other 2,161 pages of content. You won=E2=80=99t find a more
detailed computer vision course anywhere else online, I guarantee
it.

The PyImageSearch Gurus course also includes private community
forums. I participate in the Gurus forum virtually every day, so
it=E2=80=99s a great way to get expert advice, both from me and from the
other advanced students, on a daily basis.
