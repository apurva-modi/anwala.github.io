Buyer Protection Program
Undeveloped is a third party domain escrow & transfer provider. We safeguard all domain purchases conducted on our marketplace. All transactions are protected by our careful escrow process & team. Undeveloped also offer post transaction support to our buyers at no additional cost. Here is how our escrow process works:
First, we secure the domain from its current owner. Then, we help you become the new owner. Finally, we only proceed with paying the seller out after you confirm the reception of the domain.
Undeveloped's escrow agents monitor every transaction and swiftly intervene in case of a ​problem.
Sellers go through a careful verification process before they can join our marketplace.
You receive all the documentation necessary to acquire the domain from the seller.
If the seller doesn't deliver on his part of the deal, we refund you within 24 hours.
