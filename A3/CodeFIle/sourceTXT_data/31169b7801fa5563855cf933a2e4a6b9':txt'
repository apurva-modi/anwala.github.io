Mirror trading
Download strategies, templates or subscribe to signals of our external analysts and approved sellers in the marketplace. Real-time updates to settings will be sent directly to your bot so that you can trade professionally, even if you lack the technical know-how.
Shorting
Short sell your coins to maximize your returns in a bear market. When you hit a price floor, you can buy them back and pocket big earnings on your way back up.
Trailing Stop-Loss
Just like a rock climber belaying up a cliff, trailing stop-loss tracks your coin up and only sells when it hits a drop. This allows you to climb the upwards trend, and never sell too early!
Advanced automated trading made simple.
Smooth interfaces are not just for beginners.
