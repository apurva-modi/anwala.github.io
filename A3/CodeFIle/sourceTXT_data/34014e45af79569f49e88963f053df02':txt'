WHY DON'T YOU HAVE ICO LIKE OTHER START-UP PROJECTS?
We don't conduct ICO as of the moment since we are still working with the regulations in our                     jurisdiction, however, we are already on the process of getting the license from respective                     agencies. Conducting ICO without license would only hurt us getting the license.
WHY DO YOU HAVE FOUR PLATFORMS?
We made the SparkX and SparkRoom platforms to reach the vast majority of the unbanked population.                     According to World Bank findings, financial illiteracy is one of the factors that hinders many to                     be financially included. With SparkX that will serve as their digital wallet, SparkRoom will                     provide courses and programs to promote financial literacy.                     SparkPlace aims to introduce a new way of shopping using the blockchain technology and reducing the                     cost of doing online marketplace like listing fees and shopping fees. SparkPlay aims to give                     players and consumers the power to have a reward that will return the value of their in-app                     purchases unlike existing paid games and application from different application store.
WHAT MAKES SPARKX DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PAYMENT GATEWAYS?
SparkX unlike any other payment gateways not only allows peer-to-peer transfer and remittance, and                     paying utility bills, SparkX will also be integrated to our other platforms and can be used for                     micropayments to our partner brick-and-mortar and brick-and-click stores and soon, to pay for                     government dues and fees.
