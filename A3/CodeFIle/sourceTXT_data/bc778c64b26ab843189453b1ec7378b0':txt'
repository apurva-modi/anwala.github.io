10,000 retail stores in France are now selling a coupon for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Litecoin. The latter is the effort of Digital Service, a cryptocurrency company and Ingenico, a leading firm in payment solutions. Per the report, Digital Service and Ingenico have collaborated to enable 10,000 retail shops in France to sell virtual currencies.
The vouchers can then be redeemed for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, and Litecoin on Digycode’s website. Reportedly, Digital Service was able to raise revenue of $2.8 billion in 2017. Christopher Villegas, CEO of Digital Service stated that DIGYCODE had been provided for those who do not want to leave their bank information online.
The CEO also added that the service protects customers from the volatility of digital assets. While this service makes it easier for people to purchase digital currencies, the fee is higher. The higher fee has been attributed to the fact that it is being shared by three providers which are Ingenico, tobacconist, and Digital Service.
