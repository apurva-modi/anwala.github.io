Before bitcoin, did you use deflationary money (gold, silver) as an alternative to fiat?
Before the financial crisis in 2008 (when bitcoin was under construction), did you know about the crimes of the federal reserve? Did you ever think about what money really was, before this dark period of history unraveled in front of the world?
