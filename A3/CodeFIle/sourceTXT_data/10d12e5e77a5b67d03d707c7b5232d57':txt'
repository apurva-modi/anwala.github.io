With Valentine’s Day just past , even if you don’t have someone to spend it with, the cryptoverse is there for you (and probably equally lonely, so don’t worry, you have friends in us). The candles we usually eat dinner with come from charts, and our hearts start racing when we see the market turn green – red is not a good color, no matter how romantic it might seem. (Unless you like to short.)
This week started with more news about the QuadrigaCX case , the BitTorrent Token airdrop , and Tron partnering some more . A new Bitcoin ETF workaround was proposed and withdrawn , Binance CEO questioned decentralization and Coinbase told users they can keep their private keys on the cloud . New obstructions in the Mt. Gox case were revealed , JPMorgan announced their own coin , and the week ends with the community still under the influence of those news .
