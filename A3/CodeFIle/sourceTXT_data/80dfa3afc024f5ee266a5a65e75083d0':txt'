Login to websites like never before.
No more username & password combinations. No more SMS authentication. No more 2FA. All you need is in a single function, supported by all DigiByte wallets. No need to remember all the different passwords, or (even worse) store them in a single application.
Keep your legendary items safe!
Experience, ranks, items and community respect? All that lost for a forgotten password or a hacked account? Not anymore. With Digi-ID, blockchain-based tech protects your game accounts.
Secure building entrances or keep your valuables safe.
Digi-ID can be integrated with physical security systems to replace swipe cards or biometrics.
Prove it's really you!
Aren't we a little too far ahead for paper ID? It's time to make lives easier, help the environment and make forgery next to impossible. All in a single move.
Love online shopping but hate creating accounts?
Same here. That's why we made plugins for many e-commerce platforms. Just scan a QR code aaaand check your tracking number. Yes, that simple.
