Counterwallet is a free web-wallet for Bitcoin and Counterparty , the world's first protocol for decentralized financial tools.
Secure
All encryption is handled client-side. Neither your passphrase nor any of your private information ever leaves your browser.
Counterwallet passphrases are highly secure, and protect your wallet from any brute force attacks. They are also rather easy to learn and hard to mistype.
Simple
With Counterwallet, your passphrase is literally your wallet, and all of your addresses and keys are generated on-the-fly when you log in.
There are no wallet files to backup or secure, and using your passphrase you can access your wallet from any trusted machine with a web browser.
Open-Source
Counterwallet is entirely open-source, so you know that it works exactly the way that it is supposed to.
If you like, you even run your own Counterwallet server.
