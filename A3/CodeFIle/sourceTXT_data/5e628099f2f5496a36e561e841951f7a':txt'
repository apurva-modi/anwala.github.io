 Shorten links and earn bitcoin 
Mellow Ads now offers you a completely free link-shortening service which allows you to EARN BITCOIN from your links!
How does it work?
Register or Sign In as a Mellow Ads publisher
Add your links (via Publish > Add link on the menu)
Share your shortened link wherever you like, for example...
Post on your favourite social network: Facebook, Twitter etc
Publish on your own website or blog
Advertise it on the Mellow Ads banner or pop-under advertising network
(or your preferred 3rd party ad network!)
Earn bitcoin for each verified click* on your link!
How much will I earn?
Our rates are dynamic and depend on the advertising income that we receive. Our commitment is to pay out 90% of all advertising revenue that we receive for clicks on shortened links.
How and when will I be paid?
Link earnings are credited to your Mellow Ads account at around midnight (UTC) each day - along with any other publisher earnings you might have. All payments are in bitcoin and can be withdrawn from your Mellow Ads account directly to your bitcoin wallet at any time.
* At the end of each day we count up all the unique, verified clicks of your link and this total is used to calculate your share of the revenue for that day. A click is 'verified' when the visitor completes the captcha and then continues on to the destination URL.
