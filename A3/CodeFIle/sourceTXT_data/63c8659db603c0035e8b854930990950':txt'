I don't.
My wealth gets stolen from me to rescue the 'too big to fail' banks and I and everyone I know gets poorer as a result. If I have 'too much' money in my account and I happen to live in the wrong country, I get a 'hair cut' where my wealth is outright stolen from me, otherwise it's just inflated away in a slow and stealthy manner so they hope I won't notice.
Even when I do the 'right' thing and avoid debt and save for my future, my savings rates go down from 5%+ to less than 1% because the government has given them so much money they have no incentive to attract mine.
Now, nearly a decade later, wages are still below 2008 levels, people are 'underemployed' desperate for full time hours but only getting 10-20 hours a week, savings rates are below 2% and these lying bastards are somehow still making more and more profit and foreclosing on houses because the banks were bailed out but the people were not, even though it was the finance sector that caused this mess.
The next crash will make 2007/2008 look tame in comparison. We will see negative interest rates as still nobody is learning the lesson about fixing the roof when the sun was shining. And I'll end up paying for that as well. For something which is nothing to do with me.
So no, I don't love it when a bank fails. Because instead of just letting them fail and bailing out the correct people (the customers who lost deposits), governments always react in completely the wrong way and bail out the banks instead.
