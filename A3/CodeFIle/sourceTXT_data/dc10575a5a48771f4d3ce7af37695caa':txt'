Each person is only entitled to receive the full bounty reward by completing all the necessary tasks once.
Any users attempting to conduct malicious activity such as signing up with bots, using multiple accounts, using fake accounts, or using compromised accounts will be immediately banned from the program, and have their credentials blacklisted, barring them from taking part in any future online programs.
Tokens will only be distributed after the token sale has ended (dependent on operations procedure).
The management reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions and award its participants accordingly.
