BlocPal is an innovative digital wallet which makes it easy for businesses and individuals to manage their digital assets. Through developments in critical partnerships like Bittrex, and other crypto exchanges in the works, BlocPal supports an expanding list of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ethereum. Additionally, BlocPal supports a growing number of fiat like the Canadian and US Dollars.
Setting up your BlocPal Wallet is as easy as 1-2-3.
Creating a wallet is very simple. When you’re in the WALLETS tab you will see an option to +Create a Wallet. A new window will appear prompting for the Wallet Name.
Enter a secret passphrase. This is very important! Ideally you want to have a phrase known only to you and not easily hacked. For your safety it is not recommended to take a screenshot because your photos are often accessible by third-party apps. Write it down and put it in a safe place.
Once you have established and secured your passphrase a notification will appear that you have successfully created your wallet.
On BlocPal, you can create as many wallets as you’d like. Create one for personal use and one for business to keep track of your transactions. BlocPal is available for iOS and Android devices.
