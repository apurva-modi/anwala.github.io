Phase 3
By the time clients reach Phase III, living sober has become second nature and we begin introducing a new focus: their continued success and future. As our clinical team continues with drug and alcohol treatment, clients begin taking classes and working in new jobs. This is where the rubber meets the road and a true plan of action for transition to sustainable success begins.
