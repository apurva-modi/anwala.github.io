Interac/BTC/RBC problems.
I sold some bitcoin through local bitcoins and received money through e transfer.
I just found out today that my ability to e transfer incoming or outgoing has been blocked for fraud (the funds came from a fraudulent account). I went to my bank and filed a request for interac to unblock me.
What happens next?
