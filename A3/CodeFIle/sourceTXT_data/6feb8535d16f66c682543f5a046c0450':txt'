The price just showed a sign of breaking the strong resistance line un the weekly timeframe and there is descending channel
Formed in between , as we all know the price usually break the steepy resistance of a descending channel .
So We'll wait for a clear sign of breakout and a retracement before going long..

May I ask why do you think the resistance is broken? I'm not sure about it.
