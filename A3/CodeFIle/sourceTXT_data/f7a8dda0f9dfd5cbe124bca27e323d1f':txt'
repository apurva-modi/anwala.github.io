FINANCE
Hi guys, I am having troubles with withdrawing my funds from Crypto Capital. My withdrawal request is pending more than a month so far. The response i got from CC is that that they have some sort of issues with their bank partners. Unfortunately I really need those money now.
What do you suggest me to do?
EDIT:
