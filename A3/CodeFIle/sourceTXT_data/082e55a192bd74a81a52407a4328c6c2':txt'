Confidential payments – HCX PAY utilizes several privacy techniques and technologies to obfuscate transaction outputs using “ring signatures" and hide transaction amounts transacted with ring confidential transactions (RingCT) utilizing cryptographic committments - represents amounts without revealing amounts.
Unlinkable transactions – HCX PAY transactions can’t be linked between the sender and the recipient enabled by dual key stealth addresses to hide the destination of the address being paid.
Conditional payments – HCX PAY utilizes advanced technology to enable event, time, behavior, human data,  and IoT activity based payouts with trusted oracles.
Egalitarian proof-of-work – HCX PAY hash function is designed for CPU and/or GPU mining for performant processing
Tokenized asset-to-payment swap – HCX PAY enables tokenization and automated payouts on healthcare and non-medical wrap-arounds
ASIC Resistant – HCX PAY CryptoNight algorithm adjustments reduce the risk of miner centralization and consequential network security damage
Adaptive limits – HCX  PAY network intelligently adjusts its parameters based on the historical data.
Payment widgets and SDKs – HCX PAY to support revenue management,  HSA, POS, Apple,  FHIR,  Google, and  exchange integration.

DOCUMENTATION
HCXP mining is an opportunity to participate in the development of a next generation private insurance and healthcare payment network and receive token rewards (HCXP) for providing computer resources (proof-of-work) enabling greater consumer privacy, lower transaction costs, and the streamlining of inefficient processes. 
Given the recent launch of the network, we believe it is possible to make a profit and mine a decent amount of HCXP via our HCX PAY hosted mining node.  We anticipate HCXP will be available to trade on exchanges in Q2/Q3 2019. 
Managed account fees cover CPU costs, storage, electricity, network bandwidth, 24/7 monitoring, software updates, security, and operations support.
