I agree with you. Fiat is usefull for payments.
IMO Bitcoin is better for having an inflation-less store of value (a bit like gold but much better).

Except for the 80% inflation last year.

Look at the big picture. BTC has been around for 10 years now.

A community dedicated to Bitcoin, the currency of the Internet. Bitcoin is a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. You might be interested in Bitcoin if you like cryptography, distributed peer-to-peer systems, or economics. A large percentage of Bitcoin enthusiasts are libertarians, though people of all political philosophies are welcome.
