It Was pretty straight forward following the guide that was provided! I had a few software problems but continued to persist through any issues that came up. I learned a lot over this week and would recommend everyone that truly believes in this technology to set one up!

Thank you very, very much! I had tried the Stadicus one in the past but always ran into insurmountable problems (for my capacity).
Your reply is highly appreciated!
