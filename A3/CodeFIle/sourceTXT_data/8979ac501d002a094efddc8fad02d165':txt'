My take on all who claim that BTC will go to 250k, $1 mil, etc.
There are still articles coming out with notable people in BTC claiming or predicting BTC would go to 250k or whatever exorbitant level.
They rationalize their prediction based on the past price patterns, logarithmic regression, etc etc etc...  and say that the price is bound to follow the rule like it is destined to do so. But my own take is that this kind of mathematical modeling totally discounts the actual supply and demand dynamic.
I remember back in 2017 when it climbed from $1k to $20k there was frenzy in media, worldwide fervor and great FOMO phenomenon. We do not have any of that today. Re-reaching the ATH of $20k, requires the same kind of irrational exuberance. And what does it take to get to 250k, 1-mil would require even more crazy bidding.
Simply put, I don't see how BTC will even get back to $20k any time soon, let alone 250k by 2022 like Tim Draper says. That's only 3 years away.
