Hello Traders,
I'm looking for a drop on this paire back to the bottom of this side way channel and break down or one more impulse to the upside,
Last week NZD paires spiked to the upside due the meeting of the RBNZ, but i don't see that impulse can extend more for upside in the near future,
Trade with care.
