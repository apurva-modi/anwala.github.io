According to the new dashboard’s landing page , Premium subscribers can expect to receive actionable trading ideas, real-time charts, sophisticated custom trading tools and real-time data from over 25 different crypto exchanges.

TradingView notes that the Premium package will remove all advertisements while allowing for up to 5 different devices to be connected at the same time. This includes in-app, on mobile and on the web, all of which are able to push 200 different types of notifications directly to the user.
Similar to the basic TradingView functionality, users are able to add up to 25 technical indicators on a single chart with fully customizable chart layouts. TradingView also has a social element where users are able to share their ideas with one another to further the conversation and improve charting and trading.
It is unclear at this time whether TradingView will adjust the BTC cost downward as Bitcoin’s price recovers, but the current fixed rate definitely benefits those looking to signup in a bear market, especially if we see another major pull-back.
