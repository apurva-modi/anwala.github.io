Terms and conditions of the contest:
The mechanics of the contest will be the same as in the previous event, through Gleam we will propose a series of actions (click on like, retweet, visit a page …), which when doing them will be assigning tickets to the participants, once the contest is finished, the application will make a random selection of tickets from which the winners will be chosen, so that the more tickets that have been awarded, the greater the chance of winning one of the prizes.
