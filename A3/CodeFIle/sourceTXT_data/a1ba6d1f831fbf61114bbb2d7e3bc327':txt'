Hey everyone,  After many months of hard work, Roopesh, Eric, and I are pleased to announce an initial version of WireGuard for macOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wireguard/id1451685025?ls=1&mt=12 This is built from the same code base as our existing iOS app and makes use of Apple's Network Extension API to provide native integration into the operating system's networking stack. The application lives in the status bar, and after importing a configuration, the ordinary System Preferences networking item may also be used to control each tunnel. Because it uses these deep integration APIs, we're only allowed to distribute the application using the macOS App Store (whose rejections, appeals, and eventual acceptance made for quite the stressful saga over the last week and a half). Compared to the current CLI integration, we expect the WireGuard experience using this app to be excellent.  For curious folks without a Mac (or without the patience to cajole KVM into booting macOS), I've assembled a few screenshots: https://data.zx2c4.com/wireguard-for-macos-screenshots-february-2019/ This is new software, and there will certainly be problems. Don't hesitate to email team at wireguard.com directly with bugs as you encounter them.  Enjoy!  Regards, Jason  PS: Because people will inevitably ask: yes, a Windows client is on its way, and it will have a very similar interface to this macOS one. We're taking the long and careful route, writing a new TUN driver for Windows 7+ called "Wintun" that we expect to be safer and faster than the current popular OpenVPN TUN driver, and also suitable for all projects, not just for WireGuard. We already have packets flowing and things generally work well, but polish will require a bit of patience. If you'd like to help and have an appetite for NDIS drivers, Win32 GUI programming, or Go, please do get in touch.
