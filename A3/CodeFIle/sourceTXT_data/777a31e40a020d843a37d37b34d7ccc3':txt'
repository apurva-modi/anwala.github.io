Do not question the thought leader, and his army of noobs.
Edit: The commenter below is correct. I shouldn't say "noobs" as it implies they're all new. In fact, there are people who have been around for years who fall for Richard's bullshit too.

Calls out crypto noobs. Reddit account only a year old which shows that you have only been in crypto for about a year. It’s all good son, farm that karma!

My account is 1 year and 10 months old, and that only shows how long I've been on Reddit - not how long I've been in crypto.
I'm not interested in karma. You're making a lot of assumptions. Regardless, I'm entitled to express my opinion on the subject.

Your comment provided no value other then seeking upvotes. Sad you cannot admit that to yourself.  No issue w u starting your opinions just questioning motivation.

I didn't really expect upvotes on a post which seemed to be buried. I was just replying to the OP. Your assumption implies that any flippant remark, by anybody, is to gain karma. That's a weird position to hold.
What value would you like to receive from me?

None, b/c your intentions are not for growth of crypto

Thank you for the chat. Good luck in your endeavours.

Marques, it's nice that you've made a bit of money with your website - but you've not been making any sense on here. This isn't the first time you've jumped into a Bitcoin Hex related thread, all guns blazing.
You seem to acknowledge that it's probably a scam. You also told me that you see value in helping crypto. I've also seen you comment that too many people only care about making money from crypto.
Bitcoin Hex is a project which adds no value to crypto, and is solely about making money. Why then, do you react so negatively when people call it out? What am I missing here?
