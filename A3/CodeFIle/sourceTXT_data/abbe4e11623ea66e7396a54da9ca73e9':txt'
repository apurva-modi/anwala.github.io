@ForecastCity , Hey. We use in our approach graphic patterns that work in all markets. This analysis makes it possible to find simple repetitive patterns of market price behavior. For intraday / swing trading is better not to think, because trend consolidation often leads to a breakthrough and price movement further. Historically, consolidations take the form of geometric models that can be framed. If the price moves ahead and is fixed beyond the framework, this is a signal for action.
