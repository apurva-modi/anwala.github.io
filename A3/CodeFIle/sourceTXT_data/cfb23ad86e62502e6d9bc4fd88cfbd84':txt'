I disagree to some extent, as I think Banks use of XRP will affect the price, but no Bank is going to reply on Ripple as the sole corridor; there will be occasions when the receiving/correspondence Bank is not connected and/or there is no viable currency pairing. So this said, I do expect a slow rise, but I do not feel anything above $20 will ever be likely and I think that will take many years - my guesstimate is 5+. That said, you are completely right, with public acceptance the price is likely to rise and I think we are close to seeing a very visible acceptance by some Banks which will drive public acceptance.
I still feel we have a long way to go from the perspective of the fiat value of XRP, but I think we are heading in the right direction. What is also very promising which may accelerate my estimate is the increasing use of agile methodologies and monthly development sprints in Banks. This too is somewhat early, but a couple of big players doing this with Ripple will be a nice boost to the technology and then in time to adoption and price.
