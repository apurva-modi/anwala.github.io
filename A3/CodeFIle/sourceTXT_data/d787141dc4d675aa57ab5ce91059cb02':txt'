I’ve been using Crypto credit/debit cards for a number of years. Wirex was my favourite until recently. Wirex allows you to send crypto (BTC, ETH, LTH) to your Wirex wallet. Then you have to convert it to fiat to load up your card before spending in shops. However, since June 2018 I’ve had a trial card from AlliancePay. Only 500 people were lucky enough go for the trial. It allows me to convert my BTC to a crypto token called Dasc. I simply purchase them on 1 of a few exchanges that trade Dasc. Then I send them to my DasWallet for secure storage using my ledger nano S. I send the Dasc to my AlliancePay hotwallet in my Daswallet. Now it’s ready to be spent at merchants. I’ve used it to pay for multiple things and different countries. I’ve used it in the UK and also when I went for a pilgrimage to Mecca and Madinah in Saudi Arabia. It converts your Crypto Dasc at real-time when you spend it to local fiat. Their transaction time of less than 3 seconds allows this to happen without the Merchant knowing that you’ve just spent crypto in a real time transaction. You can not do this with other less slower blockchain time crypto like BTC and ETH as it would not be practical at the tills if you have to wait for 20 mins on average for your transaction to be approved. I think Dasc will lead the way in crypto spend-ability with their partnership with AlliancePay and Carta Worldwide ( the company that developed ApplePay and VodaphonePay technology). Hope this helps anyone that’s interested in the topic.
