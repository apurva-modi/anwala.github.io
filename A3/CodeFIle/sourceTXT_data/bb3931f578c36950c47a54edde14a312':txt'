ALSO, SINCE THE TRADES HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, THE RESULTS  MAY HAVE UNDER-OR-OVER COMPENSATED FOR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF  CERTAIN MARKET FACTORS, SUCH AS LACK OF LIQUIDITY. SIMULATED TRADING  PROGRAMS IN GENERAL ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE  DESIGNED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING  MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFIT OR LOSSES  SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN.
All results shown on this website are  hypothetical, back-tested results.
No representation is being made that any account  will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those  shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between  hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently  achieved by any particular trading program. Hypothetical trading  does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record  can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual  trading.
