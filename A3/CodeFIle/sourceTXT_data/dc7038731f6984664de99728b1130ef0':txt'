Paraguay bought pesticides and fumigation products worth $7,100 from Argentina using Bitcoin.
Latin America has recently seen a surge of crypto usage as bad governance and hyperinflation has left citizens with no choice.
In a landmark event, Paraguay has bought pesticides and fumigation products worth $7,100 from Argentina using Bitcoin . The Bitcoin was then converted into Argentine peso to pay off the agricultural chemicals. These payments were made via Bitex, a Latin American financial services provider.
This is the latest in the series of mainstream crypto-usage coming out of Latin America. The region as a whole has been suffering from hyperinflation and lousy governance and has looked to cryptocurrencies as a way of escaping financial tyranny from their governments. As reported by FX Street , Venezuelaâ€™s weekly trading volume exceeded 2,000 bitcoins and hits record highs way back on February 6th. FX Street also reported that the Bitfury Foundation and South Korean R&D group, Commons Foundation, are collaborating to launch Bitcoin mining centers in Paraguay.
