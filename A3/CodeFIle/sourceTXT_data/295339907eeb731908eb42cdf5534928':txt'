Guidelines
Do not use URL shortening services: always submit the real link.
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.
Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, /r/CryptoCurrency is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.
Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
No referral links in submissions.
No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.
