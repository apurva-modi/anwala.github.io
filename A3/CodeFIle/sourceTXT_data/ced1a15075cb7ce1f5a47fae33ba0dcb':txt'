Yeah.  I used MtGox like everyone else back in the day, but I got all my coins and money out of there before it collapsed.  I remember that for a good couple months before it all fell apart, there had been many issues and a lot of speculation that they were about to collapse.  Anyone who lost coins with MtGox either wasn't paying attention to the what was going on, or maybe just didn't heed the warnings.
