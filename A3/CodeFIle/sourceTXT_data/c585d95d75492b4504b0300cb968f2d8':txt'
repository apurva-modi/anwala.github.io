I've watched "Escaping the Global Banking Cartel" a few times and have new insights with every viewing.
The overall message is borderline revolutionary and conspiratorial, but each point made is spoken like an obvious truth.
Essential viewing for anyone who views the cryptocurrency movement as the beginnings of a broad re-balancing of global power structures to a more peer-to-peer, fair, decentralized model.
