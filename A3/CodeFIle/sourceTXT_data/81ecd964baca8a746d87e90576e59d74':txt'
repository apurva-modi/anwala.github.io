We’re launching a new Coinbase Earn page where users can earn Zcash (ZEC)
Today we’re launching a new Coinbase Earn opportunity with lessons about Zcash (ZEC) .
If you’ve received an invite to the Coinbase Earn ZEC Page by email, you can go to the Earn ZEC page to start completing the educational lessons and earn up to $3 worth of ZEC in the process.
Zcash is a cryptocurrency which uses recent advances in cryptography to give users the option to protect their financial privacy when transacting with cryptocurrency. Zcash does this by offering two types of addresses–“transparent” addresses and “shielded” addresses. A good analogy for this distinction is HTTP (unencrypted) and HTTPS (encrypted). In both cases, the unencrypted version of the protocol is transparent, which allows third parties to see information about the transaction, while the encrypted/shielded version protects this information. This can help keep your financial information safe, so it can’t be sold, shared, or spied on by third parties. You can learn more about Zcash and its privacy design by watching the educational videos on the Earn ZEC Page .
We expect earning to become an increasingly important function in the crypto ecosystem–alongside buying and mining–especially when paired with education. We hear from people that they’re always looking for trusted sources to educate themselves about new developments in crypto, and we want to help serve that need.
If you haven’t received an invite to earn yet, don’t worry — you can still view all content on the page for free, and you can join the waitlist to be notified once earning opportunities become available to you. If you want to stay informed about future opportunities, please make sure you have verified your identity and opted in to marketing communications with Coinbase!
Lastly, you can check out the newly-launched Coinbase Earn homepage to keep up to date with the latest Earn opportunities.
