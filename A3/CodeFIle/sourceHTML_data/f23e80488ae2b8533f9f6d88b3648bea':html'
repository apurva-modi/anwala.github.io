		<div>Team-Europe / AIWare</div>
		<div>We believe that a trading card game must work on a blockchain basis. That's exactly what we want to achieve with our game.

A game that is fun. That's as good as a TOP Game from the industry. That you can play fast among friends without long waiting times. Desire to get to know a great story. With its own shop system and great community to exchange views. With unique cards and booster packs.

All on blockchain basis and unusual and intuitive GUI.
</div>
		<div>min. 500 EUR</div>
		<div>We have already started with the basic programming. Here we have laid the foundation and are in the combat phase. We expect the development time for this phase to be around 2-3 months to cope with this phase. At the same time we work on the design of the cards.

Here we may want to rely on cell shading but still miss a cool style with a drawn look. But we are not 100% in agreement yet. For the next 3 to 4 weeks, we want to push the combat system aside and start with the menu. Here we want to specifically optimize the game on smartphones and tablet users.

We believe that when we first start with the GUI we will get a better feel for the game. If that is what we are going to build the combat system on.

		<div>CANNABIS BREEDING GAME
</div>
		<div>Crypto Cannabis is a blockchain technology housed DAPP (Decentralized Application) Game. The game begins by creating the gene plants of smart contract "Legacy Landrace Strains" by utilizing the TRON Foundation cryptocurrency (TRON TRX) and PotCoin Cryptocurrency. These plants are obtained by mining the TRC20 Smart Contract strain types with SativaGeneSeed and IndicaGeneSeed TRC10 tokens depending on the smart contract strains GeneSeed genetic makeup. These TRC10 strains are then integrated into game play. Game Brief:

-Initial Crypto Cannabis game ecosystem build launch.
 -Social media community growth and community groups commences.
-ITO pre-sale and main sale will open up for the general public to invest into the Crypto Cannabis in game asset tokens and CCGX Mutual Fund Game Shares.

-Pre-Sale of dispensary licenses will issue out to participants in the crowd-sale to have ready for the full game launch. 22 Legacy Landrace Strains exist in all. Each Legacy Landrace Strain is a TRC20 smart contract containing only a 1,000 quantity card limit of each Legacy Landrace Strain type. From here in game Legacy Landrace Strain’s when crossbred will unlock new hybrid smart contract strains. All strains are worth TRX and will intrinsically raise in value throughout longterm progressions of the game, in example alike to Crypto Kitties.
</div>
		<div>The ITO will progress with a soft cap of 2,750,000 TRX to fund the development team building the back end of the game engine and deployment of the TRC20 mineable smart contract strain types. CryptoCannabisGame (CCGX) Mutual Fund Game Shares will begin trading and listing upon the TRXMarket ring Q1 2019. Upon full game development completion of beta testing and live launch there will be new game additions issued out in development to bring more in depth game play that will be very interesting to game players and new rare smart contract TRC20 mineable strains being developed and available to be mined (grown) to be obtained and profited from owning and selling.

There are several investment packages to choose fro that carry rewards and good ROI (return on investment incentives)- Custom Strain Name Offerring: Only 50 Offerring’s In All: Initial 25,000 TRX / TERC Equivalent


</div>
		<div>We will Transfer on your Adress the GOT Tokens. Thx for your Support. 
</div>
		<div>80 TERC = 100 GOT 
</div>
		<div>At times as well there will be exchange trading competitions that will be held annually where traders use DEXCOIN to buy and sell certain cryptocurrencies during the trading competitions. Highest volume traders showing buys and sells with DEXCOIN (DEX) will win great high value prizes of cryptocurrencies like BITCOIN, LedgerNano’s and other great prizes that will grow to be prizes like vacation packages, cars, etc.

Stock Exchange With Digital Asset Stocks:
In longterm after main exchange launch, DEX Exchange will obtain a firm with licensed stock brokers and will offer digital stock share TRC10 decimal precision tokens backed by actual company stock shares like APPLE, TESLA, ALIBABA and more. All of these digital stock shares will be paired to be bought and sold with DEXCOIN (DEX) TRC20. This allows an ability for a wider customer user base of stock traders and cryptocurrency traders to succeed the DEX Exchange product and the DEXCOIN (DEX) value as a utility and digital asset. Now stock investors and cryptocurrency investors have the ability to buy and sell fractional amounts of company stock shares instead of having to buy the entire stock share.
</div>
		<div>With these bonuses you can apply an easy ability to fund your tokenized project to further succeed being in the public on the exchange. Exchange listing fee is set at 2,000,000 DEXCOIN. Investing your business and or tokenized platform/project during the ICO Tier phases gives you discounts off of this entire entire fee. If for example you invest TRX/TERC equivalent into 2,000,000 DEXCOIN, you will have bonus amounts of DEXCOIN as an extra ROI for your portfolio to short and or hodl as a long term investment with value growth over the years, as well as while enjoying trade fee discounts. You further more join into to the DEX Mutual Fund that carries an estimate 11% to 12% annual return respectively in TRX or Bitcoin quarterly.

All DEXCOIN spent into DEX Exchange for listing fees and or trading fees will be forever burned within its own smart contract decreasing the long term total supply while increasing the total longterm demand.
</div>
		<div>IF YOU PAY  WITH TERC 
+ 20% BONUS</div>
		<div>There is a total supply of 500,000,000 DEXCOIN (DEX) TRC20. 250,000,000 DEXCOIN will be burned long term unit only 250,000,000 remain in existence, so owning a large piece of DEXCOIN by investing during the ICO gives great incentives in the shorter and longterm as a tokenized project and or an individual and independent investor whom wishes to become a customer of DEX Exchange to retain profits on initial investment and receive longterm benefits of investment profits return as well.


</div>
		<div>Pre-investing in DEXCOIN (DEX) TRC20 during the ICO will give investors a short term and long term profit ROI (ReturnOnInvestment) within the first year of launch and running the exchange. By owning DEXCOIN (DEX) as an exchange customer you receive trade fee discounts year to year by holding DEXCOIN in your wallet while buying and selling cryptocurrencies. DEXCOIN (DEX) is the DEX Exchange native utility cryptocurrency and pairing tool for all listed in house cryptocurrencies.

If you are a business with a sturdy and safe tokenized project that is succeeding itself and wish to list onto DEX Exchange, DEXCOIN (DEX) enacts as the payment method of listing fee. Once the exchange launch and runnings occur, DEXCOIN value will intrinsically be managed to increase in valuation year to year.
