<h3>Why you should use ETH Invites?</h3>
<p>Did you ever saw another ethereum project which gives you eth for only inviting your friends to join their project? In case you are living under a rock ethereum is the second largest crypto currency and it is more usable than bitcoin -  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/903911/Ethereum-price-what-is-Ether-ETH-cryptocurrency">Second largest cryptocurrency soars more than $20 BILLION in a week</a>.</p>
<p>Also our website is super simple to use even for your relatives which don't know how to even use computer.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>How much can i earn in reality? Do i get paid in ethereum?</h3>
<p>This really depends on your skills to invite as many people as you can. For example you can post in facebook and if you have many friends you will get many refferals and you will earn more eth. If you want to introduce anybody to ethereum you can direct them to this  <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Wesite</a>. For one invited user you will get from 0.01 free ETH and you will need to invite at least 5 people to be able to withdraw eth to the wallet.<br /><br /></p>
<h3><em>Special Promotion!</em></h3>
<p>Currently we running a promotion where you can earn as much as 0.25 ETH in a few minutes just by sharing your link in forums, facebook etc.. We recorded many people that can achieve these results if they send invitations to all their friends or promote in places like facebook, forums etc. This offer won't last long as ethereum price increases every day and we have a limited supply to share. <br /><br /></p>
<h3>How to earn 20% extra just by sharing your personal link?</h3>
<p>We offer our users bonus chance to earn 20% more to your total earnings just if you before withdrawal share our link on social networks (google+, twitter and facebook).<br /><br /></p>
<p><em>Be aware, there are some extra steps doing withdrawal...</em></p>
<p>When you are withdrawing ethereum you might in some point see offers which are made by our sponsors and you have to complete them. To be honest 100%  this is how me make most of our ethereum and it is from our sponsors. So we can have eth to pay all our users. These offers can be different for example you have to install some free app on your phone. 99% of this ethereum goes straight back to pool to pay for our users and 1% goes to the fees for project hosting and staff. We are hoping for your understanding.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>Having problems completing verification?</h3>
<p>If you are having any problems with withdrawal or others first please check these common solutions:<br /><br /></p>
<h3>First things are to check if you have adblock plugins or programs on your computer or mobile phone</h3>
<p>If you use our website with any adblock software some elements can be not displayed. For example some scripts can be blocked, invitation system or withdrawal process so always check if you run any software. Also it can block crypto wallets too. So in order to complete withdrawal verification to your ethereum faucet just turn off any software that blocks any elements on websites.</p>
<br /><br />
